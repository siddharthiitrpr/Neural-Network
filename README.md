# Neural-Network
Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Neural Network Project
Project Idea: Create a deep learning model using neural networks to predict the size and position of holes in a cantilever
beam based on various input parameters, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in structural analysis.
Application: This project can be utilized in civil engineering for non-destructive testing of beams, ensuring structural
integrity and safety, and in manufacturing to optimize material usage and design processes.
